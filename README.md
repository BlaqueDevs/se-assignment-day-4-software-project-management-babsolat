## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
ANSWER: Timely delivery is crucial in software project management to meet client expectations, delivery and cost or budget management. Project managers can ensure deadlines are met by setting clear goals, monitoring progress, and adapting plans as needed.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
ANSWER: Effective cost management ensures resources are utilized efficiently and project objectives are achieved within budget. Strategies to avoid budget overruns include comprehensive budgeting, consistent tracking, and risk assessment.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
ANSWER: Agile is an iterative and flexible approach, whereas Waterfall follows a linear and structured path. The benefits of Agile include adaptability and strong customer engagement, while its drawbacks can involve scope creep and reduced predictability. In contrast, Waterfall provides defined timelines and requirements, but it may lack flexibility and be slower to accommodate changes.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
ANSWER: Agile is more beneficial for projects with evolving needs, such as software development and marketing campaigns, while Waterfall is better for projects with stable requirements, like construction and manufacturing. For instance, developing a mobile app works well with Agile, whereas creating a new product line in a factory aligns with Waterfall. Other examples include Agile for website redesigns and Waterfall for pharmaceutical research projects.


## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
ANSWER: Quality assurance can be ensured by i) followig International standard for quality management systems (ISO 9001).
                                            ii) Setting up Framework for improving process maturity.
                                            iii) making sure project deliverables meet the required standards and satisfy customer expectations.
                                            
Maintaining high standards is important to ensure that project deliverables meet required specifications, prevent defects, and satisfy customer expectations.


## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
ANSWER: Defining the project scope establishes clear goals and limits, helping align all stakeholders. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) decomposes the project into smaller, manageable components, facilitating organization and resource management.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
ANSWER: 
A comprehensive project schedule is essential for prioritizing tasks, allocating resources efficiently, and monitoring progress throughout the project lifecycle. It helps ensure that everyone is aligned on timelines and responsibilities. 

Gantt charts enhance this process by visually displaying the project timeline, making it easier to identify task dependencies and critical deadlines. This visual representation allows project managers to quickly assess the status of the project and make necessary adjustments to keep everything on track.
